# Problem

The rise in weather-related damages in the United States over the past 40 years reflects a significant challenge. These damages encompass a wide range of issues including housing and auto damage, as well as personal health impacts. One key factor contributing to this situation is the limitations in weather prediction technology. Accurate prediction of storm patterns, intensity, and paths is crucial in reducing the cost and impact of weather-related damages.

Focusing on Florida, the state is particularly vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes, which are often life-threatening and cause substantial damage. Your approach to addressing this issue involves the use of AI and AlexNet to track lightning strikes. This is an innovative method that could potentially offer significant insights into weather patterns and storm trajectories.

1. **AI and Weather Prediction**: AI can analyze vast amounts of data much faster than traditional methods. By incorporating various data sources, including historical weather patterns, real-time weather data, and geographical information, AI can enhance the accuracy of weather forecasts.

2. **AlexNet and Lightning Analysis**: AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that is highly effective in image recognition tasks. Applying this to the analysis of lightning strikes can help in understanding the patterns and possible development of storms. By tracking the frequency, intensity, and location of lightning strikes, you can potentially predict the evolution and path of a storm.

3. **Improving Storm Predictions**: With more accurate predictions of storm paths and intensities, it becomes possible to better prepare for and mitigate the effects of these natural events. This can lead to reduced damage to property and infrastructure, as well as improved safety for individuals in affected areas.

4. **Challenges and Considerations**: While this approach is promising, it's important to consider the complexity of weather systems and the variability of factors influencing storm development. Additionally, integrating AI and AlexNet into existing weather prediction models requires careful calibration and validation to ensure reliability and accuracy.

5. **Potential Impact**: If successful, this approach could revolutionize weather prediction, particularly in areas prone to severe storms like Florida. It could also serve as a model for other regions facing similar challenges.

In summary, the goal is to use AI and AlexNet to predict weather patterns and storm trajectories by tracking lightning strikes is a forward-thinking approach that could significantly contribute to reducing weather-related damages, especially in hurricane-prone areas like Florida. The success of this project could have far-reaching implications for weather forecasting and disaster preparedness.

## Data Deck
The dataset is divided into two main categories: 50 slides featuring skies with lightning and 50 slides featuring skies without lightning. This approach is strategic for several reasons:

1. Variety of Locations: By capturing images of the sky above different environments like water bodies and urban areas, you can account for the varying effects these landscapes have on weather patterns. For example, urban heat islands can influence storm development differently compared to over water.

2. Lightning vs. Non-Lightning Skies: The comparison between skies with and without lightning is crucial. It allows the AI model, presumably using AlexNet, to learn the distinguishing features of stormy versus non-stormy conditions. This contrast is essential for the model to accurately identify the onset of storm conditions.
  
3. Image Recognition and Pattern Analysis: Using AlexNet, a powerful tool in image recognition, you can analyze these photographs to identify patterns and characteristics associated with storm development. This could include cloud formations, lightning frequency and intensity, and other atmospheric conditions visible in the images.
   
4. Training the AI Model: The dataset serves as a training ground for the AI. By exposing it to various scenarios, the model can learn and improve its predictive capabilities. The balance of 50 slides each for lightning and non-lightning conditions ensures that the model is not biased towards one type of weather condition.

5. Challenges and Considerations: One challenge in this approach is ensuring that the dataset is comprehensive and representative. Factors like time of day, season, and geographical diversity need to be considered. Additionally, the quality and resolution of the images are crucial for accurate pattern recognition.

6. Potential Applications: If successful, this method can be used to predict lightning and storm development, which is vital for early warning systems. This can significantly help in disaster preparedness, especially in areas frequently hit by severe storms.
Extending Beyond Lightning: While the focus is currently on lightning, this methodology could potentially be extended to predict other weather phenomena, such as heavy rains, hailstorms, or even tornadoes, by adapting the type of data fed into the model.

In summary, the use of sky images in different locations with and without lightning presents a comprehensive approach using Alexnet to training an AI model for weather prediction. This method holds promise in enhancing the accuracy of predicting storm patterns and intensities, which is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigating weather-related damages.

## Alexnet

Input Layer (conv1): The first layer is the input layer where the network takes in the image. The image is typically broken down into its red, green, and blue (RGB) components, each forming a separate channel. The depth of this layer (number of channels) is usually 3, for the 3 color channels in an image.

First Convolutional Layer (conv1): The first convolutional layer applies numerous filters to the input image to create a feature map. This process captures the basic features of the image, such as edges and corners. The depth of this layer is determined by the number of filters used, in this case, 64.

Second Convolutional Layer (conv2): The second convolutional layer takes the output of the first layer as its input and applies additional filters to capture more complex features. The number of filters increases, which is typical in CNNs as deeper layers capture more complex features, in this case, 192 filters.

Third Convolutional Layer (conv3.x): This layer has three consecutive convolutional stages (conv3.1, conv3.2, conv3.3) without pooling in between, which is a characteristic feature of AlexNet. It enables the network to learn even more complex features. The number of filters increases with each stage, here shown as 384, 256, and 256 respectively.

Fully Connected Layers (fc4, fc5, fc6): After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done through fully connected layers.Neurons in a fully connected layer have full connections to all activations in the previous layer. These layers are typically designed to flatten the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector of features. The first two fully connected layers (fc4 and fc5) have the same number of neurons, usually a large number like 4096. The last fully connected layer (fc6) reduces the dimension to the number of classes in the dataset.

Softmax Layer (fc6+softmax): The final layer is a softmax function, which is used to generate probabilities for the various class labels. The softmax function takes the raw scores from the last fully connected layer and normalizes them into probabilities that sum to one. The output dimensionality of the softmax layer corresponds to the number of classes the model is designed to recognize.

Each layer in the network extracts increasingly complex features. Early layers might identify simple edges, textures, or colors, while deeper layers might identify more complex structures like shapes or specific objects. After training on a large dataset with labeled images, the network can use the features it has learned to classify new images with similar characteristics. AlexNet was particularly noted for its success in the ImageNet competition, drastically reducing the error rate for image classification upon its introduction.

AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that was designed to classify images into a large number of categories. To explain how AlexNet works in Python, we would use a deep learning library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to build the model.
