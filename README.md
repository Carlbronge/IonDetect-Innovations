# Problem
## Rising Cost of Extreme Weather Damage
In the United States,over the course of 40 years, there has been an extreme rise in weather damage. These damages can include housing damage, auto damage and personal health. These problems come from a lack of technological analysis in weather prediction. Being able to predict storm patterns, storm intesity and storm path are all important in lowering the cost of weather damage. In Florida, a majority of weather damage comes from tropical storms and hurricanes, where most of the damage can be threatening to life. Using AI and Alexnet, my goal is to track the amount and location of lightening strikes to predict weather patterns and storm trajectories.
