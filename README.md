# Problem

The rise in weather-related damages in the United States over the past 40 years reflects a significant challenge. These damages encompass a wide range of issues including housing and auto damage, as well as personal health impacts. One key factor contributing to this situation is the limitations in weather prediction technology. Accurate prediction of storm patterns, intensity, and paths is crucial in reducing the cost and impact of weather-related damages.

Focusing on Florida, the state is particularly vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes, which are often life-threatening and cause substantial damage. Your approach to addressing this issue involves the use of AI and AlexNet to track lightning strikes. This is an innovative method that could potentially offer significant insights into weather patterns and storm trajectories.

1. **AI and Weather Prediction**: AI can analyze vast amounts of data much faster than traditional methods. By incorporating various data sources, including historical weather patterns, real-time weather data, and geographical information, AI can enhance the accuracy of weather forecasts.

2. **AlexNet and Lightning Analysis**: AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that is highly effective in image recognition tasks. Applying this to the analysis of lightning strikes can help in understanding the patterns and possible development of storms. By tracking the frequency, intensity, and location of lightning strikes, you can potentially predict the evolution and path of a storm.

3. **Improving Storm Predictions**: With more accurate predictions of storm paths and intensities, it becomes possible to better prepare for and mitigate the effects of these natural events. This can lead to reduced damage to property and infrastructure, as well as improved safety for individuals in affected areas.

4. **Challenges and Considerations**: While this approach is promising, it's important to consider the complexity of weather systems and the variability of factors influencing storm development. Additionally, integrating AI and AlexNet into existing weather prediction models requires careful calibration and validation to ensure reliability and accuracy.

5. **Potential Impact**: If successful, this approach could revolutionize weather prediction, particularly in areas prone to severe storms like Florida. It could also serve as a model for other regions facing similar challenges.

In summary, the goal is to use AI and AlexNet to predict weather patterns and storm trajectories by tracking lightning strikes is a forward-thinking approach that could significantly contribute to reducing weather-related damages, especially in hurricane-prone areas like Florida. The success of this project could have far-reaching implications for weather forecasting and disaster preparedness.

## Data Deck
The dataset is divided into two main categories: 50 slides featuring skies with lightning and 50 slides featuring skies without lightning. This approach is strategic for several reasons:

1. Variety of Locations: By capturing images of the sky above different environments like water bodies and urban areas, you can account for the varying effects these landscapes have on weather patterns. For example, urban heat islands can influence storm development differently compared to over water.

2. Lightning vs. Non-Lightning Skies: The comparison between skies with and without lightning is crucial. It allows the AI model, presumably using AlexNet, to learn the distinguishing features of stormy versus non-stormy conditions. This contrast is essential for the model to accurately identify the onset of storm conditions.
  
3. Image Recognition and Pattern Analysis: Using AlexNet, a powerful tool in image recognition, you can analyze these photographs to identify patterns and characteristics associated with storm development. This could include cloud formations, lightning frequency and intensity, and other atmospheric conditions visible in the images.
   
4. Training the AI Model: The dataset serves as a training ground for the AI. By exposing it to various scenarios, the model can learn and improve its predictive capabilities. The balance of 50 slides each for lightning and non-lightning conditions ensures that the model is not biased towards one type of weather condition.

5. Challenges and Considerations: One challenge in this approach is ensuring that the dataset is comprehensive and representative. Factors like time of day, season, and geographical diversity need to be considered. Additionally, the quality and resolution of the images are crucial for accurate pattern recognition.

6. Potential Applications: If successful, this method can be used to predict lightning and storm development, which is vital for early warning systems. This can significantly help in disaster preparedness, especially in areas frequently hit by severe storms.
Extending Beyond Lightning: While the focus is currently on lightning, this methodology could potentially be extended to predict other weather phenomena, such as heavy rains, hailstorms, or even tornadoes, by adapting the type of data fed into the model.

In summary, the use of sky images in different locations with and without lightning presents a comprehensive approach using Alexnet to training an AI model for weather prediction. This method holds promise in enhancing the accuracy of predicting storm patterns and intensities, which is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigating weather-related damages.
